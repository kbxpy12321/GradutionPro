# OpenMP-CUDA-Matrix-Multiplication
## 1. Introduction
This is a program to learn matrix mulplication algorithms using OpenMP and CUDA, and some Qt GUI.
## 2. Algorithms
+ Normal matrix multiplication (with OpenMP and CUDA)
+ [**Strassen algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm) (with OpenMP)
+ [**Cannon's algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon%27s_algorithm) (with OpenMP)
+ [**DNS algorithm**] (http://parallelcomp.uw.hu/ch08lev1sec2.html) (with OpenMP)
+ Algorithms fusion (e.g. Normal + Strassen, Cannon + Strassen) (with OpenMP)
